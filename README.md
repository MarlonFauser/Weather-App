## Getting Started

To initiate the project we need to get the files and put in our local machine.

### Prerequisites
 
 To build and run this app for development or production mode we need to be certain that we have two
 components installed: NPM, Yarn and React DOM
 
### Installing

Step by step of how to install them.

```
-cd weathernow
-npm install --save react react-dom
-yarn install
```
After that you can run:

After the last command line the terminal will send a command to open our browser in our localhost with default port 3000, running the app.
